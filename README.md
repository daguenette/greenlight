# Project from Let's Go Further by Alex Edwards.

All commits will follow each chapter name.

## 1 - Getting Started

- Create a skeleton directory structure for the project and explain at a high-level how our Go code and other assets will be organized.

- Establish a HTTP server to listen for incoming HTTP requests.

- Introduce a sensible pattern for managing configuration settings (via command-line flags) and using dependency injection to make dependencies available to our handlers.

- Use the `httprouter` package to help implement a standard RESTful structure for the API endpoints.
